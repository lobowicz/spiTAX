        <div class="answers-container">
            <p class="q">What is a nonresident alien?</p>
            <p class="a">A nonresident alien (NRA) is any individual who is not a U.S. citizen or U.S. national, who does not pass the substantial presence test or the green card test.</p>

            <p class="q">Do I have to pay/file/submit taxes?</p>
            <p class="a">Yes, all F-1 visa holders regardless of employment or not need to file their taxes.
                <br> <br> If you worked last year, you received tax documents from your employer (likely a W2 or a 1099 of some sort). You will need that form(s). You also need to file a form 8843. If you did not work, then you need to file a form 8843.
            </p>

            <p class="q">Do I have to file a nonresident state tax return?</p>
            <p class="a">It depends! Each state in the US has different tax laws. Depending on the state where you live, you may be required to file a state tax return.
                <br><br> Nine US states don’t impose any income tax on income – Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming.</p>

            <p class="q">When do I get my refund?</p>
            <p class="a">If you are eligible for a refund you must submit your application as a non-resident via the mail to the IRS on/before April 15 and will receive the refund in July-October. 
                <br> <br> If you elect to have it be a direct deposit, please list your valid US bank account. If you want a check, give them a mailing address where you will be later this Fall. <br>
                <br> If you don't know where you will be in the Fall/Summer or are leaving the U.S. this Spring/Summer, ask a friend you trust to use their mailing address. <br> 
            </p>

            <p class="q">I do not have a Social Security Number (SSN). Can I file taxes?</p>
            <p class="a">Yes, but if you are not filing only the 8843, then you need an ITIN or an SSN. 
                Reach out to UR's Office of International Taxation for information on how to get an SSN.
